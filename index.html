		 <h2> This is my coding the past and A timely soultion website. You will find my work from project one Coding the past here. For Daramola's class we had to interview a family member about their life to discover their human geography. We created a scribble map to show where our family members has been and an annotated transcript. For Noel'class we had to create a layerd self prtrait for our self and the person we interview. You can also find my work for project two. On Daramola's second page you will find my 3D sketch, 3D model and press release. Noel's second page will show off both child labor and social media poems, collages and artist statements. The menu bar will take you to each teacher's respective pages</h2>
