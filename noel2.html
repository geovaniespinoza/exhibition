	<h3> 
	The past and the present 
How different are the past and the present 
How similar are the past and the present 
In the past 
The first factory in the united states was opened in 1790 
The first school opened in America was in the 17th century 
In the present 
Millions of factories are still up and operational in the united states
Over 246,000 thousand schools are operating in the united states
In the past
Schools taught children to read and write 
In the present 
Schools are outdated systems that train our youth to become factory workers
The sky’s the limit they tell you
 Then for the next fifteen years they tell you how to act 
How to think 
Where to sit 
When to speak 
When to eat 
What to wear 
Eight hours a day 9 to 5 
Single file line 
Raise your hand to speak 
Involuntary Manslaughter
Killing all creativity and individuality since 1635 
An ongoing case the people of the jury refuse to look into 
Freedom of expression is stripped away from us because her shoulders are to distracting and inappropriate and this is what they think we should wear
Freedom of speech is taken away from us when I can’t have a conversation with my teacher because legally they can't talk about their stance about politics or religion because that would mean giving teachers some form of individuality 
Your creativity is nothing more that just a number on point system, your creativity is nothing more than a letter grade, your creativity is nothing more than just something that someone grades based on how well you think like them  ‘
A system for the people by the people where everyone's supposed to be equal 
But for some reason we haven't come up with a squeal
